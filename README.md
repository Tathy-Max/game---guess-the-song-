## The mechanics

The game's goal is to guess the song's names throughout hints reaching the end of the game's fourth holding the **maximum score** as possible. An initial score of one hundred points is given to the player at the start game. This score is increased when the player guesses the name of the song, or is decreased each time the player clicks to get a new hint, or misses the name of the song after the third attempt that each round offers. Attempts can be made at any time by typing a guess on the input button. The answer must be sent via the check button to be verified. The check works whether the guess was typed using uppercase or lowercase.
If the score reaches zero points, the game is over.
Each round the player will find: a new song to guess, three hints to help and three chances to try a guess.
Have fun!

## Inspirations

My main inspirations for this project were the passion for music and games, a TV show that I loved to watch in my childhood and the desire to develop my technical skills in the web development field.

## ## Technology Used

JavaScript, HTML and CSS were used to build the game, without additional frameworks. Interactions were created using DOM manipulations. For each round, functions and events are called to iterate through an array that contains all the information for all the songs in the game.

## Special Thanks

My special thanks go to the Ironhack teaching staff who helped me all along the project: Karen Okasaki, Anna Reis, and Alexandre Lima. Also, thanks to all my classmates, especially Tulio Minini.
